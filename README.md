# TLabShareScreen
A software encoder server application with a simple video codec using Nvidia's CUDA.
A GPU that can use CUDA is an operating condition for this software.  
I released a client asset for unity. You can download it from the link below.
Although it was not possible to record due to spec problems (probably),  
it works in the same way as a video even if it is run on an actual Android device.

This is an asset, and users can use it freely.
However, the downloaded project has a build configuration for Android,
so if you want to build for another platform, please change the appropriate settings.
