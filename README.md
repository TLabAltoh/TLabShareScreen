## client software
### for unity
I released a client asset for unity. You can download it from the link below.
Running on a real Android device works the same as the video above. However, it did not work properly with Oculus quest 2.

The downloaded project has a build configuration for Android. So if you build for another platform, change the appropriate settings.
